What is Subarray/SubString?
- Official meaning is that its the contiguous part of the array, but for easier understanding its basically its like subsets. For example, you got a array like [1,2,3,4], how many subsets you can get from this?
    - [1], [2], [3], [4], [1,2], [2,3],[3,4], [1,2,3], [2,3,4] and [1,2,3,4].
IN TOTAL: 10 non-empty subarrays.
