🏋️ Array Core Basics – Practice Sets (JavaScript)
🔹 Level 1: Warm-up (Basics)
Create an array of 5 numbers → print the first and last element.
Update the 3rd element in the array to a new value → print the array.
Add a new element at the end (push) and at the start (unshift).
Remove the last element (pop) and the first element (shift).
Find the length of an array.

🔹 Level 2: Looping Practice
Loop through an array of numbers and print each element.
Loop through and print only even numbers.
Loop through and calculate the sum of all elements.
Find the maximum number in the array.
Count how many odd numbers are in the array.

🔹 Level 3: Mini Challenges
Reverse an array manually (without .reverse()).
Find if a number x exists in the array.
Print the array in this format: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.
Create a new array with each number doubled (no .map(), just loop).
Find the second largest element in the array.

🔹 Level 4: Algorithmic Flavor (Boss Stage)
Given an array, shift all zeros to the end.
Count how many times a given element appears in the array.
Rotate the array by 1 position to the right.
Find the missing number in [1,2,3,5,6].
Check if the array is a palindrome (reads same forward/backward).

✅ With this set, you’ll get fluent in accessing, updating, and looping through arrays — the foundation for all advanced array methods (map, filter, reduce).
